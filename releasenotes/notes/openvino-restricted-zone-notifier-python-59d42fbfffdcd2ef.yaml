    This Restricted Zone Notifier application uses the Inference Engine
    included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit and the Intel®
    Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit. A trained neural network detects people
    within a marked assembly area, which is designed for a machine mounted
    camera system. It sends an alert if there is at least one person detected
    in the marked assembly area. The user can select the area coordinates
    either via command line parameters, or once the application has been
    started, they can select the region of interest (ROI) by pressing c key.
    This will pause the application, pop up a separate window on which the
    user can drag the mouse from the upper left ROI corner to whatever the
    size they require the area to cover. By default the whole frame is
    selected. Worker safety and alert signal data are sent to a local web
    server using the Paho MQTT C client libraries. This sample is intended
    to demonstrate how to use Inference Engine included in the Intel®
    Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit and the Intel® Deep Learning Deployment
    Toolkit to improve assembly line safety for human operators and factory
    workers.
