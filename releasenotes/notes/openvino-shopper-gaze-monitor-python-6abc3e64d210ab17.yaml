    This Shopper Gaze Monitor application uses the Inference Engine included
    in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit and the Intel® Deep
    Learning Deployment Toolkit. It is designed for a retail shelf mounted
    camera system that counts the number of passers-by that look towards the
    display vs. the number of people that pass by the display without looking.
    It is intended to provide real-world marketing statistics for in-store
    shelf-space advertising.
