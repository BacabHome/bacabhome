    Parking lot counter is one of a series of reference implementations
    for Computer Vision (CV) using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™
    toolkit. This application is designed for a parking space area mounted
    camera which monitors available parking space by tracking the counts of
    the vehicles entering and leaving the parking space area. This example
    is intended to demonstrate how to use CV to monitor parking spaces in
    dedicated parking area.
