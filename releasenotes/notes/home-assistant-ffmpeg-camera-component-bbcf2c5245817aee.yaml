    The ffmpeg platform allows you to use any video feed as a camera in
    Home Assistant via FFmpeg. This video source must support multiple
    simultaneous reads, because for every concurrent Home Assistant user,
    a connection will be made to the source every 10 seconds. Normally this
    should not be a problem.
