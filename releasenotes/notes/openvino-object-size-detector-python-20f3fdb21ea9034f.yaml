    This Object Size Detector application is one of a series of computer vision
    (CV) reference implementations using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™
    toolkit. This application demonstrates how to use CV to detect and measure
    the approximate length, width and size of assembly line parts. It is
    designed to work with an assembly line camera mounted above the assembly
    line belt. The application monitors mechanical parts as they are moving
    down the assembly line and raises an alert if it detects a part on the
    belt outside a specified size range.
