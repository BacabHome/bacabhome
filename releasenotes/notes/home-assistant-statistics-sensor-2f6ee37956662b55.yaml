    The statistics sensor platform consumes the state from other sensors. It
    exports the mean value as state and the following values as attributes:
    count, mean, median, stdev, variance, total, min, max, min_age, max_age,
    change, average_change and change_rate. If itâ€™s a binary sensor then only
    state changes are counted.
